# ComputationalProject 

The software implementation of the popular card game Blackjack is called the Python Blackjack project. People all over the world enjoy playing the casino game blackjack, usually referred to as 21. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as near to 21 without going over it as you can with your hand value. A player loses the hand and the game if their hand value is higher than 21.

The desire to create this project was sparked by a love of card games, especially Blackjack, but it was also an act of retaliation for a previous failure to complete the project's coding. The goal of this project is to develop a fun and engaging way for people to play and understand many blackjack variations. 

The project provides three distinct versions of the Blackjack game:

1.	Classic Blackjack: This version follows the traditional rules of Blackjack, making it ideal for those who are familiar with the standard game. It features deck creation, player interaction, hand value calculations, and an automated dealer.

2.	Blackjack with a Twist: In this variation, the value of the Ace is changed from 11 to 1. This change introduces a unique challenge and strategy for players.

3.	Spanish 21: Spanish 21 utilizes a different deck, removing all 10s. The game includes a specialized deck creation, player choices, and hand value calculations following Spanish 21's specific scoring rules.

The project includes the following features:

- Three different versions of Blackjack.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Interactive gameplay with choices for players.
- Automatic dealer functionality.
- Hand value calculation and checking for winning conditions.
